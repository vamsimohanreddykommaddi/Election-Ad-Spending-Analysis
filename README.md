# Election-Ad-Spending-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes election ad spending data to understand its impact on voter turnout across different states and election phases. The analysis explores patterns in ad expenditures and their correlation with voter engagement.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Investigate the relationship between **ad spending and voter turnout**.
- Identify **top-spending parties and states**.
- Examine spending trends across **different election phases**.
- Visualize data using **Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The analysis utilizes datasets containing:
- **Advertiser Data** – Political parties and organizations running ads.
- **Location Data** – Ad spending per state and constituency.
- **Election Results** – Voter turnout and election outcomes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- **Data Visualization** (Histograms, Pie Charts, Scatter Plots, Bar Charts)
- **Statistical Analysis** (Correlation between spending and voter turnout)

## 📈 Key Analyses & Visualizations
- **Total Ad Spend by State** – Bar chart to display state-wise ad expenditure.
- **Top 5 Political Parties by Ad Spend** – Pie chart representation.
- **Ad Spend vs. Voter Turnout** – Scatter plot to observe trends.
- **Spending Distribution** – Histogram with box plot for detailed insights.
- **Election Phase-Wise Analysis** – Dual-axis bar & line chart.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```
2. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Run the analysis scripts in a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
4. View the generated visualizations and insights.

## 📌 Results & Insights
- Significant correlation observed between **higher ad spend and increased voter turnout**.
- Certain states received **disproportionate ad budgets**, indicating targeted campaigns.
- Phased election analysis showed **spending peaks during critical voting periods**.

## 📜 Future Enhancements
- Integrate **machine learning models** to predict voter turnout based on ad spend.
- Expand dataset to include **social media engagement metrics**.
- Automate **real-time data collection** for dynamic analysis.
